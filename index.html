              What are JS Functions?
            </h2>
            <div class="text-container">
              <p>
                Functions are a fundamental aspect of JavaScript, a programming
                language. In JavaScript, functions are structured blocks of code
                specifically designed to carry out a particular task or set of
                tasks. When a function is called upon or 'invoked', it then
                executes the task it was designed for.
              </p>
              <p>
                The way to define a function in JavaScript is by using the
                'function' keyword. This is then followed by a unique name given
                to the function. The name is followed by a set of parentheses
                (). The rules for naming functions are similar to the rules for
                naming variables in that function names can contain letters,
                digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Inside the parentheses, parameter names can be included and
                these are separated by commas for clarity (parameter1,
                parameter2, etc.). Following the parentheses, the specific code
                that the function is designed to execute is placed inside curly
                brackets: {}.
              </p>
              <p>
                For instance, let's consider a simple JavaScript function whose
                task is to add two numbers together. It could be defined like
                this:
                <span class="span-code-style"
                  >function addNumbers(a, b) { return a + b; }</span
                >. To invoke this function, you would call it with two numbers
                as arguments, like so:
                <span class="span-code-style">addNumbers(3, 4)</span>. The
                function would then perform its task and return the result of
                adding the two numbers together.
              </p>
              <p>
                In JavaScript, functions can also be assigned to variables. This
                is known as a function expression. A function expression does
                not necessarily need to be given a name, it can be defined as an
                anonymous function. For instance,
                <span class="span-code-style"
                  >let x = function (a, b) {return a * b};</span
                >
                is an anonymous function that multiplies two numbers. To call
                this function, you would use the variable name, like so:
                <span class="span-code-style">x(4, 5)</span>. This will return
                the result of 4 multiplied by 5.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, JavaScript introduces an interesting concept known
                as the callback function. In simple terms, a callback function
                is a function that is passed into another function as an
                argument. The callback function is then invoked inside the outer
                function. This concept is a key component of asynchronous
                programming in JavaScript as it allows the execution of code to
                continue without having to wait for the function that was passed
                as a callback to complete.
              </p>
              <p>
                Last but not least, JavaScript also supports a more recent
                feature known as arrow functions, introduced in ES6. Arrow
                functions offer a more concise syntax to write function
                expressions. They are particularly useful for non-method
                functions and it's important to note that they cannot be used as
                constructors.

            <div class="text-container">
              <p>
                <b>Named Functions:</b> These are the standard function that we
                define using the
                <span class="span-code-style">functions</span> keyword followed
                by a name. The name is followed by parentheses, which can
                include parameters separated by commas. The code to be executed
                by the function is placed inside curly brackets {}. An example
                of a named function is:
                <span class="span-code-style">
                  function addNumbers(a, b) { return a + b; }</span
                >. This function is called with two numbers as arguments and it
                returns the sum of these two numbers.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Function Expressions:</b> These are functions that are
                assigned to variables. The function itself can be anonymous,
                which means it does not necessarily need a name. The function is
                defined and then assigned to a variable. When calling this type
                of function, the variable's name is used. For instance,
                <span class="span-code-style">
                  let x = function (a, b) { return a * b };</span
                >
                is an example of an anonymous function expression that
                multiplies two numbers. To use this function, you would call it
                with the variable name and two numbers as arguments like this:
                <span class="span-code-style">x(4, 5)</span>. This will return
                the result of 4 multiplied by 5.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Callback Functions:</b> These are functions that are passed
                into another function as an argument and then invoked inside the
                outer function. This is a fundamental aspect of asynchronous
                programming in JavaScript, which allows the execution of the
                code to continue without waiting for the function that was
                passed as a callback to complete. Callback functions can help to
                manage and control the flow of the program, especially when
                dealing with asynchronous operations.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Arrow Functions:</b> Arrow functions were introduced in ES6
                as a new way to write shorter function syntax. They are
                particularly useful when a function is placed into a variable -
                making it a function expression. Arrow functions are anonymous
                and change the way
                <span class="span-code-style"> this</span> binds in functions.
                They are best suited for non-method functions, and they cannot
                be used as constructors. An example of an arrow function is:
                <span class="span-code-style">const x = (a, b) => a * b;</span>.
                This function multiplies two numbers and returns the result.
              </p>

            <h2 class="subtitle" id="scope-and-stack">Scope and Stack</h2>
            <div class="text-container">
              <p>
                In JavaScript, each function creates a new scope. Scope
                determines the visibility or accessibility of variables,
                functions, and objects in some particular part of your code
                during runtime. In other words, it defines the portion of the
                code where a variable or a function can be accessed.
              </p>
              <p>Let's consider a simple example:</p>
              <pre>
                            <code>
                                function exampleFunction() {
                                    let x = 10;
                                    if (true) {
                                      let y = 20;
                                      console.log(x + y);  // This will output 30
                                    }
                                    console.log(y);  // This will output 'undefined'
                                  }
                            </code>
                        </pre>
              <p>
                In this example, <span class="span-code-style">x</span> is
                accessible within the entire function
                <span class="span-code-style">exampleFunction()</span>, but
                <span class="span-code-style">y</span> is only accessible within
                the <span class="span-code-style">if</span> block.
              </p>
              <p>
                The JavaScript engine executes the function code from top to
                bottom, and as it executes, it creates a execution context. For
                each function call, a new execution context is stacked on top of
                the previous one, creating a call stack. When a function
                finishes execution, its execution context is popped off from the
                stack, and control reaches to the context below in the current
                stack.
              </p>
              <p>Consider the following example:</p>
              <pre>
                            <code>
                                function firstFunction() {
                                    console.log('First');
                                    secondFunction();
                                    console.log('Back in first function');
                                  }
                                  
                                  function secondFunction() {
                                    console.log('Second');
                                  }
                                  
                                  firstFunction();
                            </code>
                        </pre>
              <p>
                In this example, calling
                <span class="span-code-style">firstFunction()</span> creates a
                first execution context which is put on the call stack. When
                <span class="span-code-style">secondFunction()</span> is called
                inside <span class="span-code-style">firstFunction()</span>, a
                second context is created and put on top of the first one in the
                call stack. When
                <span class="span-code-style">secondFunction()</span> finishes
                executing, its context is popped from the stack, and execution
                continues in the
                <span class="span-code-style">firstFunction()</span> context.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="section">
            <h2 class="subtitle" id="nested-functions">Nested Functions</h2>
            <div class="text-container">
              <p>
                Nested functions in JavaScript are functions that are defined
                inside other functions. They are also known as inner functions.
                The outer function that encloses the inner function is called
                the parent function. The inner function can only be accessed
                from statements in the outer function.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nested functions are an important feature of JavaScript because
                they allow for information hiding and encapsulation, which can
                lead to better-organized and more maintainable code. Inner
                functions have access to the variables and parameters of the
                outer (parent) function. This is known as lexical scoping.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here is a simple example of a nested function in JavaScript:
              </p>
              <pre>
                            <code>
                                function outerFunction(a, b) {
                                    function innerFunction(c) {
                                      return a * b * c;
                                    }
                                    return innerFunction;
                                  }
                                  
                                  let result = outerFunction(2, 3)(4);
                            </code>
                        </pre>
              <p>
                In this example,
                <span class="span-code-style">innerFunction</span> is nested
                within <span class="span-code-style">outerFunction</span>.
                <span class="span-code-style">innerFunction</span> is able to
                access the parameters <span class="span-code-style">a</span> and
                <span class="span-code-style">b</span> from its parent function,
                <span class="span-code-style">outerFunction</span>. The
                <span class="span-code-style">outerFunction</span> is then
                called with two arguments, and it returns the
                <span class="span-code-style">innerFunction</span>. The returned
                <span class="span-code-style">innerFunction</span> is
                immediately called with the argument
                <span class="span-code-style">4</span>, and it returns the
                result of the multiplication of
                <span class="span-code-style">2</span>,
                <span class="span-code-style">3</span>, and
                <span class="span-code-style">4</span>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember that functions in JavaScript are first-class objects.
                This means that they can be passed as arguments to other
                functions, returned as values from other functions, assigned to
                variables, or stored in data structures.

          <div class="section">
            <h2 class="subtitle" id="closures">Closures</h2>
            <div class="text-container">
              <p>
                n JavaScript, a closure is a function that has access to its own
                scope, the outer function’s scope, and the global scope, as well
                as access to its own arguments, the outer function’s arguments,
                and the global arguments. A closure gives you access to an outer
                function’s scope from an inner function.
              </p>
              <p>
                In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is
                created, at function creation time. To use a closure, define a
                function inside another function and expose it. To expose a
                function, return it or pass it to another function.
              </p>
              <p>Here is a simple example:</p>
              <pre>
                            <code>
                                function outerFunction(outerVariable) {
                                    return function innerFunction(innerVariable) {
                                      console.log('outerVariable:', outerVariable);
                                      console.log('innerVariable:', innerVariable);
                                    }
                                  }
                                  
                                  const newFunction = outerFunction('outside');
                                  newFunction('inside');
                            </code>
                        </pre>
              <p>
                In this example,
                <span class="span-code-style">outerFunction</span> is creating
                and returning the
                <span class="span-code-style">innerFunction</span>. The
                <span class="span-code-style">innerFunction</span> is a closure
                that is closed over
                <span class="span-code-style">outerVariable</span>. This closure
                is a function (<span class="span-code-style">innerFunction</span
                >) bundled together with its lexical environment. The lexical
                environment consists of any local variables that were in-scope
                at the time the closure was created. In this case,
                <span class="span-code-style">outerVariable</span> is part of
                the <span class="span-code-style">newFunction</span> closure.
